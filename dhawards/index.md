Oceanic Exchanges, funded through the Transatlantic Partnership for Social Sciences and Humanities 2016 Digging into Data Challenge, 
brought together leading efforts in computational periodicals research from six countries—Finland, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States—to examine patterns of information flow across national and linguistic boundaries. Over the 
past thirty years, national libraries, universities and commercial publishers around the world have made available hundreds of millions 
of pages of historical newspapers through mass digitisation and currently release over one million new pages per month worldwide. These 
have become vital resources not only for academics but for journalists, politicians, schools, and the general public. However, these digitisation 
programmes share a critical weakness: the very creation of national newspapers collections obscures the fact that international news exchange 
was central to the nineteenth-century press.

*The Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata* is an open access guide to a selection of newspaper databases around the world. Its initial 
selection is limited in scope, being comprised of the ten databases (including the aggregator Europeana) for which we were able to secure 
access and licensing to the machine-readable data. Nonetheless, it aims to form the foundation of a wider mapping of collections beyond its 
current North Atlantic and Anglophone-Pacific focus. It brings together their histories and digitisation choices with a deeper look at the 
language of the digitised newspaper, the evolution of newspaper terminology and the variety of metadata available in these collections. It 
explores how machine-readable information about an issue, volume, page, and author is stored in the digital file alongside the raw content 
or text, and provides a controlled vocabulary designed to be used across disciplines, within academia and beyond.
