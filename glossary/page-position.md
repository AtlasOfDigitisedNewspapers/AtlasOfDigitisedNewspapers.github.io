## Usage Notes

Unlike the newspapers of today, many nineteenth-century newspapers,
particularly the earliest ones, did not have breaking news items on the
front pages; news stories would be added to the inside to accommodate
later submissions, while the front page would be designed in advance.
When *El Universal* was introduced in Mexico in 1888, it made the
revolutionary decision of putting the news section on the front page. In
general, newspapers were contained in wrappers that were made up of
advertisements, so the external pages would not indicate the content. As
such, knowing the situation of an article within a paper reveals
something about the structure of that newspaper. In addition, some
newspapers were made up of only one foldout sheet.

## Examples:

“Like *The Daily Courant*, *The Observator* and *The Flying Post*,
    it was printed in double columns on both sides of **a single folio
    sheet of paper**; and it came out, like *The Evening Post*, *The
    Post Boy* and *The Review*, three times a week–on Tuesdays,
    Thursdays and Saturdays.” \[Bateson, 155\]

“The differences between these editions and the original tri-weekly
    **sheet** are not limited to the differences of appearance.”
    \[Bateson, 155\]

“They were not appended to any of the material in the original folio
    **sheets**, and although the newspaper continued publication to 1752
    there were no further reprint volumes.” \[Lockwood, 91\]
