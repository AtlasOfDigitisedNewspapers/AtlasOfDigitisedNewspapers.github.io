## Usage Notes

This is a common term within library science, complicated only by the
fact that there is not a one-to-one relationship between the physical
object and the digital one in the case of newspapers. Because most
digitised newspapers come from **volumes** of several **issues** bound
together, and the majority of **libraries** do not disbind them to scan
(except, notably, the British Library), the shelf mark should be taken
to refer to the physical volume from which the newspaper issue has come,
if not the full run as defined by **normalised newspaper title**. These
volumes can be dedicated to one specific newspaper, or issues from a
specific year taken from a range of newspapers.

## Examples:

“Absolute and unchanging fixed locations are normally only found in
    older libraries and collections that are kept in their original
    rooms or buildings. This is known as a **shelf mark** or **class
    mark**, the latter term reflecting the fact that CLASSIFICATION
    numbers (sometimes abbreviated in the case of complex FACETED
    CLASSIFICATIONS are often used to derive the location mark. Fixed
    location is normally associated with CLOSED-ACCESS libraries.”
    \[Feather and Sturges, 202\]

“banden van nieuwe **signature** voorzien en ondergebracht …”
