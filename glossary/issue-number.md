## Usage Notes

The term “issue” is applied in academic and contemporary accounts to the
newspaper as a physical item, as a conceptual unit, and for additional
issues (i.e. the special issue). In contemporary Victorian accounts, the
distinction between the verb and the noun is less distinct, and as such
we have references to “the first week of \[the newspaper’s\] issue”
\[Vizetelly, 1.10\] or the discontinuation of “the issue of the paper”
\[Yates, 1.324\]. The term “number” was more commonly used in the
nineteenth century and, as such, “special issue” does not appear
commonly in the literature.

## Examples:

### As a physical object

> Masthead, with issue number above, of *Het Niews van den Dag*, 13 June 1870: 1. [Delpher](https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:000017257:mpeg21:p001). 
  
“The last **issue** in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, is marked,
    ‘Vol. xl., No. 4503,’ and dated ‘October 20, 1842.’ It
    was:--’Printed and Published by Richard Sanderson, Proprietor, at
    *The Sydney Gazette* Office, Lower George-street, New South Wales.’
    There is no intimation in this number that it is the last nor that
    it was about to cease publication.” \[Ferguson, Foster and Green,
    69-70\]

“It may well have been at her father’s suggestion that Charlotte
    sent for the files of the *Mercury* to aid in her research;
    certainly Mr. Brontë would have recalled those old **issues** of
    Baines’s paper, both on the grounds of his own contributions, and
    because of its detailed reporting of the Luddite disturbances near
    Hartshead, where he was curate from 1811 to 1815.” \[Rosengarten,
    591\]

“The paper’s liberalism showed itself even in the second half of
    each **issue**, that is, in the part devoted to reviews of
    literature and the fine arts.” \[Jump, 42\]

“he had an inveterate propensity for starting newspapers, magazines,
    and weekly periodicals, usually without the requisite capital for
    carrying out those publications to a successful **issue**.” \[Sala
    1895, 1.198\]

“he had great pleasure in accepting the poem, which would appear in
    an early **number** of the magazine.” \[Yates, 1.222\]

###  A conceptual unit

“However, other jokes printed in the same **issue** appeared in the
    US as early as the previous September” \[Nicholson 2012, 281\]

“To interact with a periodical, particularly a nineteenth-century
    periodical, is immediately to confront the question of transfer:
    should the reader apply knowledge gained in one context (say, an
    article or an **issue**) to a different context (say, a subsequent
    article, a subsequent issue, or even ‘real life’)?” \[Droge, 39\] 

“Speaking of the ‘Familiar Epistle from a Parent to a Child’ at the
    start of the March **issue**, in which Dickens facetiously addresses
    *Bentley’s* as a toddler once, but no longer, in his care, the
    *Examiner* comments that ‘every sorrow has a “sunny side”,’ for ‘Mr
    Dickens is succeeded in his late office by Mr Ainsworth—whose
    opening of the ‘romantic legend’ of Jack Sheppard has already, under
    circumstances ominous of a certain and speedy decline, infused new
    promise into *Bentley’s Miscellany*.’” \[Droge, 41\]

“No **issue** of a serial ever exists on its own but calls up the
    memory of its predecessors while projecting its successors into the
    future.” \[James Mussell, “Repetition,” 345, qtd. in Droge, 45\]

“An assignment to do a double-page spread, with illustrations, for
    the Sunday **issue** of the Globe brought him into close
    relationship with the art department.” \[Kwiat, 112\] 

“Within every newspaper **issue** some elements can be found which
    are not directly part of the content but are only included for
    providing some basic information to the user.” \[Europeana
    Newspapers 2015, 13\]

“Lehden vuosikerta, **numero**, osa, sivu, päiväys/vuodenaika
    (painettu lehti, journaali)”
