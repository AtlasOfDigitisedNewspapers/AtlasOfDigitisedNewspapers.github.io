## Usage Notes

Leader articles would usually contain around 1,200 words; however,
digital analysis has enabled researchers to analyse word counts and
revealed that different newspapers had their own standards: for example,
a leader for the *Times* in 1855 averages around 1500 words. In contrast
to the myth that Victorian writers were paid by the word, it was much
more usual for newspapers to request an article of a certain number of
<a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/page-count-of-issue/">**pages**</a>. Although the abolition of Stamp Duty and advances in printing
made it cheaper to print more pages, articles did not simply get longer:
the introduction of headlines, integrated advertisements and
illustrations all influenced article length. Added to this, there was a
stark difference between broadsides, with their densely packed columns,
and the New Journalism publications of 1880s Britain. Similar
developments took place elsewhere, with factors including paper and ink
shortages in young Australasian colonies causing publishers to
temporarily suspend publication or make use of non-standard paper stock.

## Examples:

“the **word count** at which *Times* leaders stabilize by the 1850s
    centres at just over 1500 words.” \[Liddle, 236\]

“But when I joined the staff of the *Daily Telegraph* and had a free
    hand in writing at least **three thousand words** every day…” \[Sala
    1895, 1.363\]

“I thought myself, however, sufficiently well paid with the sum he
    originally offered me, which was at the **rate of some five or six
    shillings a line**.” \[Vizetelly, 1.272\]
