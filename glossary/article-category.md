## Usage Notes

There are a wide range of different categories of article, broken
down into subject matter and format. The use of fixed [**headings**](../section-heading) from
[**issue**](../issue-number) to issue for topics such as provincial news, reviews,
advertisements and notices means that these are the most commonly used
categories in the databases. However, journalism and media history
provide a much more detailed list of categories of journalism that owes
much to nineteenth-century newspaper press directories, which first
appeared in a sustained way in the UK in the 1840s. *Mitchell’s
Newspaper Press Directory*, first published in 1846 (becoming an annual
publication in 1856), eventually included an index of topics. Palmer’s
*Index to The Times*, covering the period from 1790 to 1905, provided a
systematic index of the topics in that newspaper in which articles can
be located by broad subject headings, [**date of publication**](../date), or
[**title**](../newspaper-title) keywords.

The Gale collections have used the standard section headings from *The
Times* as a model for metadata categorisation of other papers because of
its relatively clear structure. In Delpher, section headings are
generated semi-automatically and checked by an operator.

“Journalistic genres such as **news articles, editorial comment,
    foreign correspondence, political debate, court reports, financial
    bulletins, illustrations, sports coverage and even
    advertisements.**” \[Nicholson 2012, 277\]

“These authors wrote about **Society**, **social gossip**, and such
    women’s issues as **suffrage, temperance, poverty, married women’s
    property, health**, and **athleticism**, as well as **fashion,
    marriage, travel, fine art**, and **photography**.” \[Cogdill, 176\]

“On that day, the reader could find above the *feuilleton*, the
    ‘premier-Paris,’ an **editorial column** addressing the question
    of the Orient, as well as a collection of **news stories** about
    French foreign policies, **readers’ letters**, **news copied from
    foreign sources**, a series of **local crime reports**,

“In a similar way as the five main classes of newspaper content,
    UIBK specifies text types or **genres of news** which appear in
    nearly every newspaper. Some typical examples are the
    ‘**Editorial**‘, a (subjective) statement of the publisher, the
    editor in chief with regard to a recent event or the political,
    economic or cultural situation in general. Another example are
    **book reviews**, which were first introduced in the early 19th
    century and are until today one of the classical articles in the
    ‘Feuilleton’ section of a newspaper. Other examples are **Death
    notices**, or **Job** and **Real Estate offers**.” \[Europeana
    Newspapers, 28\]
