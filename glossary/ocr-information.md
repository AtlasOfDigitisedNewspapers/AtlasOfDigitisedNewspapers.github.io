## Usage Notes

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software recognises text from
scanned pages and is also used to populate metadata fields by
identifying title information, layout, etc. OCR first pre-processes the
image into component parts such as text blocks, sentence blocks and word
blocks. This is **zoning** and is done slightly differently by different
digitisers (sometimes by article, for example). Common OCR software is
most effective on modern Roman type; older newspapers and those using
Gothic font are difficult to OCR successfully. Delpher worked with
volunteers to improve the quality of the text of newspapers,
particularly seventeenth-century newspapers and WW2 illegal resistance
newspapers while Trove crowdsources the correction of article text to
improve accuracy.
