## Usage Notes

Globally, the spread of newspapers exploded in the nineteenth century.
This also led to many new publications that were short-lived. In the UK,
the repeal of stamp duty on newspapers in 1855 saw an increase in the
number of provincial newspapers, many of which would quickly fold.
In the 1880s, New Journalism and the mass-market approach led to a
further explosion of new [**publications**](../newspaper-title). In Mexico, many newspapers
sprang up during the Mexican War of Independence to spread propaganda or
gain support but were usually quickly quashed. Most digital collections
have aimed to digitise complete runs: for example, Trove evaluates
recommendations for titles, and then aims for a complete run.
Delpher prefers to digitise newspaper titles in a complete run, but
sometimes have had to exclude issues because of [**copyright**](../publication-date-range).
Additionally, particularly with seventeenth- or eighteenth-century
newspapers, they digitise only part of the run because they focus on the
periods when the newspaper is most fashionable, most read, and most
interesting from a historical point of view. As such, the date range
recorded refers to only the selection present in the collection.

## Examples:

“**Between 1856 and 1914** the number of newspapers published in
    Britain and Ireland increased more than eightfold, from 274 to
    2,205, with London numbers tripling from 151 to 478.” \[Williams,
    99\]

“**Between 1855 and 1861**, 137 newspapers were established in 123
    English towns where previously there had been no local newspaper. In
    1861, one writer estimated that the number of newspapers in England
    had doubled from 562 to 1,102, although it was acknowledged that
    many of these titles were short lived. This expansion continued into
    the twentieth century: in 1856 there were thirty daily and evening
    London and provincial newspapers in England, but in 1900, there were
    203 and in 1914, 153. The total number of national, London, and
    provincial morning and evening papers rose from 197 in 1920 to 202
    in 1922, dropping to 164 in 1931 and down to 126 in 1944.”

“Aineistoa kerättäessä huomioitiin sekä Integrumissa mainittu
    ilmestymispäivä (lehden painettu versio) että internet-version

“I have little doubt now, on thinking over the matter, that Mr.
    Ingram had fully made up his mind to **discontinue the issue of the
    paper**…” \[Yates, 1.324\]

“On a sabbatical year in the United Kingdom from 1965 to 1966, he
    immersed himself in the journalism of the 1860s but was frustrated
    by the difficulties of ascertaining the location of copies, the
    **lengths of runs**, as well as changes in title, editorial staff,
    contributors, and affiliations of these little-known publications.”
    \[Shattock 2017a, 3-4\]

“Entire **runs** of newspapers have disappeared, and although we
    know something of Clemens’s early experience and the books he read,
    no record of his newspaper reading exists.” \[Branch, 600\]
