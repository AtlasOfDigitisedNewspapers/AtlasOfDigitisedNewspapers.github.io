## Usage Notes

As Trove’s sub-collections can be created by end-users, their variant of
this field includes the number, names, URLs and the name of creator. In
the BL collections, this indicates a broader but standardised
sub-category of publication. In the nineteenth century, newspapers were
referred to using **geographic and** **genre distinctions**, such as the
provincial press, or family papers, though such collections did not
coalesce around themes the way that digitised collections can.

## Examples:

“The letter campaign of 1894 was just the beginning of a life spent
    agitating for representation and equality for poor women. Nield’s
    career as an author began by writing anonymous letters to the
    **provincial press**…” \[Bunting, 142\]

“The emphasis on **annuals** also obscures the significance of
    **monthly periodicals** and **weekly provincial and metropolitan
    newspapers** in the history of nineteenth-century women’s poetry.”
    \[Easley 2016a, 707\]

“The *Chronicle*, like many **town papers** of the era, brought
    national issues and trends to regional readers and carried general
    reports on progressive women’s issues of the day.” \[Bunting, 143\]
