## Usage Notes

Publication frequency is an important term in understanding
nineteenth-century newspapers, as it dictated and worked together with
length, content and format to establish the character of the
publication; for example, newspapers published in multiple editions per
day were intended to be consumed more quickly, while in Australia,
paper, ink, compositor or printer shortages meant that some newspapers
would have to suspend a planned publication. Different editors could be
assigned to different editions and the content could be updated
depending on the events of the day. Very few digitised collections,
however, include these multiple [**editions**](../edition).

“In the nineteenth century, there were many frequencies –
    **morning**, **evening**, **fortnightly**, **monthly,**
    **quarterly** and **annual**.” \[DNCJ, MWT, 234\]

“… general **weeklies** for the middle classes \[…\]; **monthlies**
    for men \[…\] and women \[…\]; illustrated titles \[…\]; **monthly**
    class papers \[…\], and class **weeklies** \[…\].” \[DNCJ, v-vi\]

“In June of 1841 Hume took over the *Daily Calcutta Intelligencer
    and Commercial Advertiser* and repositioned it as the *Calcutta
    Star*, a **daily** newspaper…” \[Simons, 389\]

“Hume announced that he was starting a new **weekly** newspaper, the
    *Eastern Star*, with the first number to be published on January 5,
    1840.” \[Simons, 389\]

“The emphasis on **annuals** also obscures the significance of
    **monthly** periodicals and **weekly** provincial and metropolitan
    newspapers in the history of nineteenth-century women“ \[Easley
    2016a, 707\]

“Journalisti-lehden **julkaisutiheys** on vaihdellut tarkasteluun
    ottamani ajanjakson.”

“Mr Robinson, editor of the **evening edition**…“ \[Yates, 1.288\]

“**Frequency** is generally used as a qualifier to distinguish
    titles from the same place and time and is sometimes included as an
    edition statement (e.g., ‘Weekly ed.’).” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 11\]

“A newspaper’s **frequency** is most often found in the publisher’s
    statement or in the masthead.” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 28\]
