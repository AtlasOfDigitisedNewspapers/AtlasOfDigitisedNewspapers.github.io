## Usage Notes

It was more common for periodicals in the nineteenth century to have
subtitles than newspapers, though the blurring of [**publication genres**](../publication-genre)
makes this distinction difficult. The subtitle would be printed on the
masthead of periodicals, and could provide further information about
[**geographic coverage**](../place-of-publication), topics covered, or definitions of audience.
However, most collections do not contain fields for newspaper subtitles.

## Examples:

“**Mottos**, related titles, or statements of geographic or other
    intended audience may appear with the title in the masthead, but
    these statements are generally not considered to be part of the
    **title** and are not transcribed…” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 14\]

“Founded as a 1d weekly in October 1894 by Frederick A. Atkins with
    the **subtitle** *A Weekly Record of Christian Culture, Social
    Service, and Literary Life*, the journal aimed to ‘combine the
    highest uses of a newspaper with the more instructive services of a
    magazine’. Reflecting its subtitle, its 20 pages included topical
    commentary...” \[DNCJ, JRW, 442\]

“This inherent hybridity was registered in the *Observer*’s
    **subtitle**, *A Record and Review*.” \[Hughes, 203\]

“In 1841 *Punch*’s **subtitle** ‘the London Charivari’ had recalled
    and appropriated a Parisian model at a time when translations of
    Sue, Dumas and Féval were selling well: *London Journal* likewise
    preferred to look towards Paris.” \[King 2017, 67\]
