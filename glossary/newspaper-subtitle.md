## Usage Notes

It was more common for periodicals in the nineteenth century to have
subtitles than newspapers, though the blurring of [**publication genres**](../publication-genre)
makes this distinction difficult. The subtitle would be printed on the
masthead of periodicals, and could provide further information about
[**geographic coverage**](../place-of-publication), topics covered, or definitions of audience.
However, most collections do not contain fields for newspaper subtitles.

> Masthead including subtitle ("Devoted to the Interests of Judaism in the Australasian Colonies") and motto in Hebrew (מי לד' אלי) and English ("'Who is on the Lord's side, let him come to me!'—Exodus xxxii, 26"), *The Jewish Herald*, 12 December 1879: 1.

“**Mottos**, related titles, or statements of geographic or other
    intended audience may appear with the title in the masthead, but
    these statements are generally not considered to be part of the
    **title** and are not transcribed…” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 14\]

“Founded as a 1d weekly in October 1894 by Frederick A. Atkins with
    the **subtitle** *A Weekly Record of Christian Culture, Social
    Service, and Literary Life*, the journal aimed to ‘combine the
    highest uses of a newspaper with the more instructive services of a
    magazine’. Reflecting its subtitle, its 20 pages included topical
    commentary...” \[DNCJ, JRW, 442\]

“This inherent hybridity was registered in the *Observer*’s
    **subtitle**, *A Record and Review*.” \[Hughes, 203\]

“In 1841 *Punch*’s **subtitle** ‘the London Charivari’ had recalled
    and appropriated a Parisian model at a time when translations of
    Sue, Dumas and Féval were selling well: *London Journal* likewise
    preferred to look towards Paris.” \[King 2017, 67\]
