## Language Variants

Auflage; Editie; Painos; Edición.

## Usage Notes

The term is used to denote geographical variants, to specify size, to
indicate several issues of a newspaper published on the same day, and to
distinguish between issues published on different days of the week—for
example, a regular feature for a weekend edition. The term is not widely
used because few collections contain multiple digitised editions. In the
Gale collections, the final London edition of a newspaper is always
microfilmed, but regional editions, such as Irish or Scottish
editions, are excluded, as are editions which came out earlier in the
day. For the British Library, since 1869 and the implementation of Legal
Deposit legislation, the rule has been that a single issue per title is
supplied (usually the last edition where relevant). Multiple editions
were sometimes submitted by [**publishers**](../publisher) for the 1820s–1860s period.
Selecting which of these editions to digitise, or all of them, is an
issue under discussion with the Library’s current *Heritage Made
Digital* digitisation programme. The term was used, though not commonly,
in the nineteenth century, where “edition” more usually referred to a
specific printing of a book rather than a newspaper. edition’ more
usually referred to a specific printing of a book rather than a
newspaper.

## Examples:

### As a geographical variant

“Most were short-lived but the London **edition** of the Detroit
    Free Press, which was composed almost entirely of American humour,
    sold between 100,000 and 300,000 weekly copies during the 1880s and
    1890s.” \[Nicholson 2012, 285\] 

### To specify size

“During that time period, at least, the paper was published in
    eight-page **editions**, with each page containing four columns.”
    \[Simons, 389\] 

“The differences between these **editions** and the original
    tri-weekly sheets are not limited to the differences of appearance.”
    \[Bateson, 155\]

### Multiple issues on the same day

“Daily newspapers and some weeklies had multiple **editions** in the
    nineteenth century, that is successive **editions**, usually with
    the same date.” \[DNCJ, LRB, 431\]

“More important in every way was the offer I received from Mr. J. R.
    Robinson, my former colleague on the *Weekly Chronicle*, who had now
    become editor of the *Express*, the then evening **edition** of the
    *Daily News*, to do some work for him…” \[Yates, 1.285\]

### To distinguish between issues on different days

In 1884 the Preston Guardian had cut the price of its Saturday
    **edition** from 2d to 1½d…” \[Hobbs 2018, 45\]

“Produced in a regular rhythm of daily **editions**, containing a
    familiar staple of home news, foreign news, commercial information
    and political commentary, the newspaper embodied a Victorian sense
    of constancy and stability…” \[Cronin, 586\]

“The *Caledonian Mercury* goes a step further, interpreting
    Ainsworth’s narrative as being so enmeshed within its context as to
    warrant the extension of Dickens’s child metaphor from Bentley’s to
    Jack: ‘There is no appearance in the **number** before us of any
    change in the periodical; all is sparkling and brilliant as in the
    most favoured days of its childhood and its pains taking attentive
    nurse. “Jack Sheppard” increases upon our affection as he grows in
    stature.’” \[“Literature.” *Caledonian Mercury* 18593 (March 11,
    1839): 4, qtd. in Droge, 41\]

“From “Die Presse”, 13. Mai 1905. Professor Dr. R. v. Wettstein is
    mentioned as the author of an article about the German School
    Association. A personal opinion is expressed, as in every Saturday
    **edition** at that time.” \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 44\]

“**Edition** statements are often found in the masthead or in the
    publisher’s block.” \[[Sagendorf and
    Moore](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/conser/pdf/ccm/CCM-Module-33.pdf),
