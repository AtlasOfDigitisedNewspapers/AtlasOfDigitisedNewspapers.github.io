## Usage Notes

The term “alternate newspaper title” encompasses changes to titles over
time. Title changes were very common; these changes might take place
owing to a change of editor or publisher, reflect an aspirational change
in intended audience, indicate a move from daily to weekly or vice
versa, or signal an attempt to broaden readership by widening
geographical focus. Where a newspaper changes title, the British Library
catalogues the new title separately. Records for title changes are
linked to the former title and to the continuation title (where this
exists). For digitisation, however, they bring these titles together as
one set. Each title and title change is given a unique ID number which
is included in the metadata for scanned newspapers. In Delpher, when a
newspaper title changes, it will be given a new ID in the catalogue. In
Trove, the decision whether to digitise the change in title as a new
publication mirrors curatorial changes by the National Library of
Australia for its physical collection.

## Examples:

“**Title changes** can also reflect the consolidation of a journal
    within a particular niche market, such as the *London, Provincial,
    and Colonial Press News: A Literary and Business Journal* which
    eventually dropped the subtitle as it specialized solely on the
    press trade.” \[DNCJ, MBT, 631\]

“Newspaper ‘record sets,’ or groups of related records, typically
    involve more titles and corresponding records than those for other
    serials, due to the proliferation of **title changes** and related
    editions. Quite often a newspaper cataloger will sketch out the
    record set to create a diagram of related titles.” \[Sagendorf and
    Moore, 26\]

“The paper continued as a weekly in the twentieth century,
    undergoing a third and last **title change** to *Y Faner* before
    folding after 135 years.” \[DNCJ, AGJ, 38\]

“If a **title change** lasts for less than one year, after which it
    reverts back to its original title, do not consider this to be a
    major change…” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 16\]
