## Usage Notes

Advances in printing made it cheaper to print more pages, and this is
reflected in the growing length of issues throughout the nineteenth
century. However, there were stark differences in issue length between
different genres of publications; daily publications were often shorter
than weekly or monthly titles and provincial papers were often shorter
than metropolitan or national publications. Issue length might have also
been temporarily reduced in response to shortages of paper or ink, or if
the publisher was suffering financial hardship, as was the case of the
*Caledonian Mercury* near the end of its run.

## Examples:

“Its **four pages** carried classified advertisements and London
    Gazette announcements, shipping news, London, foreign and local
    news, Parliamentary reports, prices and advertising.” \[DNCJ, WHF,
    250\]

“All he cared for, in those days of heavily-taxed paper \[…\] was
    that a volume of a given **number of pages** should not cost more
    than a certain sum.” \[Vizetelly, 1.89\]

“On 1 October 1887 the paper switched to a smaller format, halving
    in size to a tabloid and doubling the **number of pages** to 16 at
    the same time.” \[DNCJ, MaT, 572\]

“In the 19th century newspapers not only the **number of pages**
    increases significantly but several new elements appear, e.g. pages
    are structured into several columns, the usage of sections,
    articles, advertisements, classified advertisements, becomes more
    sophisticated and complex.” \[Europeana Newspapers, 24\]
