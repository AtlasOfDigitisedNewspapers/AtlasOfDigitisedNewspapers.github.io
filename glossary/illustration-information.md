## Usage Notes

1806 saw the first illustration ever published in the *Times*, and
improved technology and reduced taxation made illustrations a central
feature of the nineteenth-century press. Illustrations became central to
new journalistic genres such as investigative journalism, though
photography did not become a central part of newspapers in the UK
until 1904, with the *Daily Mirror*. Illustration technology was most
significantly used in advertising around the world, with improvements in
technology ensuring that illustration played a greater role in the press
globally in the second half of the nineteenth century.

## Examples:

“Drawing on emergent reprographic media, initially wood engraving
    (which allowed text and **illustration** to be printed together)
    and, to a more limited extent, lithography and then a variety of
    photo-reprographic techniques, **illustration** was a central
    attribute of many nineteenth-century periodicals…” \[DNCJ, BM/AGJ,
    304\]

“*Graphic* was published on Saturdays, and ‘Place aux Dames’
    appeared every week, typically in the middle of the newspaper and on
    one page; often, her paragraphs make up the top and bottom third,
    with **illustrations** of some recent event, sometimes a sporting
    event, comprising the middle third; sometimes her paragraphs take up
    the left two-thirds of the page, with unrelated **illustrations** on
    the right.” \[Cogdill, 182-83\]

“An assignment to do a double-page spread, with **illustrations** ,
    for the Sunday issue of the *Globe* brought him into close
    relationship with the art department.” \[Kwiat, 112\]

“The ActivePaper Archive, created by Olive Software, used an image
    processing technique called ‘segmentation,’ which breaks each page
    of newspaper text down into its smaller information units (articles,
    **pictures**, advertisements).” \[Edmund King, 175\]
