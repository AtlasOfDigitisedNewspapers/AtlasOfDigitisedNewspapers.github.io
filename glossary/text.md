## Usage Notes

In literary studies, the text has a more abstract meaning somewhat
removed from the physical conditions of publishing: the same text can be
serialised, published in book form, and made available online. In
periodical studies, article text is not always referred to as such:
articles can be referred to as **items**, **pieces**, **text**,
**columns**, and so on. In the collections, text can be broken down by
word, string, article or page. 

## Examples:

“My first task was to tabulate the number of emotions expressed and
    observed in each serial installment of *The Woman in White* in order
    to reveal the emotional fluctuations occurring throughout the
    **text**’s serialization…” \[Beekman, 11\]

“The article’s tone, especially in its opening passages, is not
    unlike that of many early-to-mid-century newspaper articles that
    detail accidental deaths, for its **text** lingers not only on the
    deep sadness of the event (its melancholic, lamentable, mournful,
    grief-filled, and awful qualities) but also on its potential to
    teach readers a lesson.” \[Fieldberg, 14\]

“In the absence of anything like a working **text**, or even a
    rudimentary bibliography, it is essential to return to the original
    pages of the paper.” \[Garside, 505\]

“The ActivePaper Archive, created by Olive Software, used an image
    processing technique called ‘segmentation,’ which breaks each page
    of newspaper **text** down into its smaller information units
    (articles, pictures, advertisements).” \[Edmund King, 175\]

“For example, some were interested in researching past crimes, or
    others interested in public transport history would undertake very
    heavy **text** correcting in stories that involved these topics”
    \[Alam, 2012\]

“Currently there are mainly two ways how digitised newspapers are
    treated: Either newspapers are scanned, ordered on issue level and
    enriched with full-**text** on page level. Or the structuring is
    done on ‘article level’ which means that all articles are separated
    and structured.” \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 11\] 

“Consider the following newspaper **items** dating from the eight
    years between the summer of 1853 and the summer of 1861.” \[Branch,
    576\]

“Though these **items** are probably the source of the references in
    the novel…” \[Rosengarten, 593\]

“In March 1819, the *Alexandria Herald* published the following
    anonymous **piece**…” \[Gelmi, 151\]

“Between 1851 and 1861 he contributed several dozen **pieces** of
    varying kinds to newspapers.” \[Branch, 583\]
