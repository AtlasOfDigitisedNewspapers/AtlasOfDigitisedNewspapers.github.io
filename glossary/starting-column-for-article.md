## Usage Notes

A daily broadsheet newspaper in the nineteenth century would typically
have six or seven columns, though in the UK the abolition of Stamp Duty
in 1855 meant that the structure of the newspaper changed quite
dramatically, as advertisements were no longer used to bulk out the
<a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/page-count-of-issue/">**page count**</a> but instead were integrated into the paper itself.
Illustrated newspapers might have two or three columns and were
generally published on smaller paper.

## Examples:

### As a synonym for regular feature or article:

“In order to answer this question we must track the journey of the
    joke from its origins in New York, through its refinement in the
    papers of the mid-West, its perfection in a Wild West weekly, its
    journey across the Atlantic, its circulation in the humour
    **columns** of the British press and finally to its leap into wider
    popular discourse” \[Nicholson 2012, 274\]

“The **column** consists of about a thousand words, dominating an
    entire page and giving it a substantial weekly presence.” \[Cogdill,
    183\]

“*The Times*, the *Daily News* and the *Morning Chronicle* are
    typical of the daily broadsheet, having either six or seven
    **columns** to a page with densely set news items.” \[DNCJ, MBT,
    576\]

### As a physical layout indicator:

“This delay roughly mirrors the life cycle of two other jokes
    published in the same **column**, both of which circulated in the
    American press during the first half of January.” \[Nicholson 2012,
    274\]

“**Columns** are basic units of design in newspapers and periodicals
    that distinguish serials from most printed books and predate later
    additions of page design such as tiered headlines, subheads, font
    variation and imaginative layout.” \[DNCJ, LRB/AK, 134\]

“Yet, in the same **column**, Crane could write straightforwardly
    and even respectfully of the professional fighter, James J. Corbett,
    then training at Asbury Park.” \[Kwiat, 104\]

“During that time period, at least, the paper was published in
    eight-page editions, with each page containing four **columns.**“
    \[Simons, 389\]

“Henley paid well, a guinea a **column** (Peterson 180).” \[Gray,
    150\]

“Two **columns** over from ‘The Horrors of Delirium Tremens,’ in the
    same number of the *Missouri Democrat*, we read of a man bitten by a
    rattlesnake.” \[Branch, 578\]

“Mr. Brontë had also made several contributions to the *Mercury*’s
    **columns**, the earliest being a letter printed on December 15,
    1810, in which he protested against the wrongful imprisonment of a
    Dewsbury man.” \[Rosengarten, 591\]

“Like *The Daily Courant*, *The Observator* and *The Flying Post*,
    it was printed in double **columns**, on both sides of a single
    folio sheet of paper; and it came out, like *The Evening Post*, *The
    Post Boy* and *The Review*, three times a week–on Tuesdays,
    Thursdays and Saturdays.” \[Bateson, 155\]

### As a synonym for section (used in plural)

“There must not be ‘unpleasant’ jokes; otherwise the babies’ food
    and the condensed milks will not come into the advertising
    **columns**.” \[E.T. Raymond, *Portraits of the Nineties* (T. Fisher
    Unwin, 1921), 305, qtd. in Nicholson 2012, 282\]
