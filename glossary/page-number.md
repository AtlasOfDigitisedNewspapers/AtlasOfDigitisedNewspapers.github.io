## Usage Notes

In contrast to the myth that Victorian writers were paid by the word, it
was much more usual for newspapers to request an article of a certain
number of pages. The size of a newspaper [**issue**](../issue-number) in the nineteenth
century varied substantially depending on the publication [**genre**](../publication-genre), **format**, [**periodicity**](../publication-frequency.md), [**edition**](../edition.md), and audience. In 1859 the *Glasgow Herald*, for example, had eight pages Monday and Friday, and four pages Tuesday to Thursday. Added to this, the
newspapers expanded as improvements in technology reduced the price of
paper. The decision was not always a straightforward expansion: the
*Sheffield Weekly Telegraph* switched to a smaller paper size in 1887
but doubled the number of pages. In Australia, early newspapers mostly
consisted of four pages. In Delpher, page numbers are generated
semi-automatically and checked by an operator.

“**pages** have to be read sequentially (or, the skipping of pages
    has to be done in sequence); the entire contents of an article, or
    of a page, has to be read, for the user to avoid missing relevant
    information; copies of an article, a photograph, or of a page have
    to be paid for.” \[Edmund King, 167\]

“During that time period, at least, the paper was published in
    eight-**page** editions with each page containing four columns.”
    \[Simons, 389\]

“*Graphic* was published on Saturdays, and ‘Place aux Dames’
    appeared every week, typically in the middle of the newspaper and on
    one **page**; often, her paragraphs make up the top and bottom
    third, with illustrations of some recent event, sometimes a sporting
    event, comprising the middle third; sometimes her paragraphs take up
    the left two-thirds of the page, with unrelated illustrations on the
    right.” \[Cogdill, 182-83\] 

“The situation is even more complex, since—as Sue’s very long note
    at the end of his feuilleton shows––if the top of the **page**
    fictionalizes, the bottom of the page defictionalizes by means of
    extra-narrative digressions, by the insertion of press articles
    within the feuilleton, and by the inscription of the novel’s
    episodes in current public debates.” \[Thérenty, 38\]

“… he quickly learned that what the city editor really wanted was
    not merely accuracy but some quality that would make both the
    newspaper’s **pages** and life itself appear to be more colorful and
    interesting than was indicated by the bare facts.” \[Kwiat, 102\] 

“On the following **page** there is an outline of the series of
    decrees, British and French, which led up to the American embargo on
    trade with Britain in 1811.” \[Rosengarten, 592\]

“In the absence of anything like a working text, or even a
    rudimentary bibliography, it is essential to return to the original
    **pages** of the paper.” \[Garside, 505\]
