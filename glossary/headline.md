## Usage Notes

For most of the nineteenth century, the front page of major daily
newspapers would include classified adverts rather than headlines in a
larger font size; in the UK, *The Times* continued this practice until
the 1960s. The British New Journalism of the 1870s and 80s saw the
introduction of headlines to catch readers’ attention. Type-revolving
presses, used in the 1840s and 1850s, made it impossible to have
headlines across more than one column until the rotary presses made
it possible to design a layout horizontally rather than simply
vertically. Even when the technology allowed, Australian newspapers
were similarly reluctant to adopt them until the end of the century. The
term itself was more commonly used in the nineteenth century for book
layouts, referring to the running title, [**pagination**](../page-number) and other
information at the top of the page. Within the pages of the newspaper,
article titles were often fixed from [**issue**](../issue-number) to issue (for example
“Advertisements & Notices”, “Provincial News”), comparable to the idea
of a regular column today. Because titles were not commonly used (they
were more common in periodicals), many databases do not zone by article
but by page. Gale segments by article, but with older newspapers they do
not try to figure out where one article starts and ends. Many providers
hand-key and check titles and headlines.

## Examples:

### Front-page headlines

“Newspapers at the beginning of the nineteenth century made no
    effort, in their vertical display, to put a **headline** over the main
    story or to make sure that the main story began at the top of a
    page.“ \[Evans, 23\]

“New Journalism pioneered the use of **headlines** to give an
    eye-catching typographical emphasis to the latest piece of important
    news.” \[DNCJ, AK/MaT, 450\]

“They serve, first, as a signpost for readers, telling them what the
    most important stories are; those with the bigger **headline**
    size.” \[Franklin, 226\]

“Laajan lukijakunnan saavuttamiseksi alettiin käyttää uudenlaista
    iskevää **otsikkotyyppiä** unohtamatta sensaatiojuttuja ja human
    interest -aineistoa.”

“Beneath a **headline**, ‘Return of the North End team. Brilliant
    ovation from twenty-seven thousand people’, the *Herald* reported
    that the Public Hall ‘was packed as it has never been packed before
    by an audience representative of all classes of the community’,
    emphasising the unifying nature of the occasion.” \[Hobbs 2018,
    343\]

### Individual article titles

“The *Chronicle* again demonstrated its support for Nield with a
    report (29 Sept. 1894) **entitled** ‘Labour Meeting at Crewe:
    Messers Compton and the Factory Girls’.” \[Bunting, 141\]

“Wilkie Collins, writing in Dickens’s weekly miscellany *Household
    Words* in 1858 was more pessimistic, despairing of the quality of
    the ‘penny fiction weeklies’ that were catering to a vastly
    increased readership, the ‘Unknown Public’ of the **title** of his
    now famous article.” \[Shattock 2017b, 3\]

“Nevertheless there are several ways to detect the **headline** in
    an indirect way, by utilizing the background knowledge which is set
    out here. E.g. repeated section headings, the mentioning of the
    place and date of the news and the copyright statement may be
    utilized for this purpose.” \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 38\]

### Recurring column titles

“This penny satirical journal was started during the Reform
    agitation, and originated those periodical comments on magisterial
    decisions which subsequently became general in the newspapers, under
    the **title** ‘Justices’ Justice’.” \[Vizetelly, 1.218\]

“I supplied dramatic criticism, and a **column** of ‘literary and
    artistic gossip,’ my first attempt at anything of the kind.”
    \[Yates, 1.265-66\]

“The subjects I wrote upon in the leading **column** of the *Daily
    Telegraph* were, comparatively speaking, innumerable…” \[Sala 1895,
    1.330\]
