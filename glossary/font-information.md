## Usage Notes

It is unlikely that the font registered will accurately reflect the
specific typeface used, though the **weight**, **style** and **size**
may be more accurate. Font styles and sizes in the nineteenth century
often reflected something about the <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/maps/publication-genre/">**genre** **of the newspaper**</a>. Most
newspapers would use different typefaces for the masthead, adverts and
editorials, and some might choose to use a nondescript font for ease. As
technology made it easier to standardise, these decisions became
formalised. <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/maps/ocr">**OCR**</a> software has difficulty with older font styles and
will not always recognise them correctly.
