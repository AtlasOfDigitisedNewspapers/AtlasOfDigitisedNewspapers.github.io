## Language Variants

Volumen; Jaargang; Vuosikerta; Volumen.


## Usage Notes

The term “volume” refers to either: collections of several newspaper
[**issues**](../issue-number), published at the end of the year, by a certain writer (or on
a certain theme), or bound together from the issues as they were
published; or, a numbering decision made by the [**publisher**](../publisher), often to
indicate a new publisher or editor. As newspaper issues were intended to
be printed and consumed quickly, rather than kept and revisited,
publishing volumes offered readers a more expensive, lasting edition of
the articles. Sometimes, the new volumes would include additional
[**illustrations**](../illustration-information).

The term is often used to refer to the bound collections held by
libraries. Many digitisers rely on these volumes as the bound format
better preserves them; however, this binding does not guarantee
completeness or correct sequencing, as these volumes can be dedicated to
one specific newspaper, or issues from a specific year taken from a
range of newspapers. Most digitised collections began with microfilmed
collections, which in term were largely derived from bound volumes. This
affected the suitability of many microfilm reels for digitisation and
OCR processing. With regard to the Trove collection, the State Library
of South Australia generally dis-bound its copies when microfilming,
as did the Library of Victoria, or they loosened the bindings during the
microfilming process in order to deal with margins and so on. Other
digitisers indicate that they do not usually dis-bind, as it is not
usually possible to re-bind them, and this threatens the physical
object; many collections in the US were damaged during
20<sup>th</sup>-century microfilming owing to the destruction of this
binding. More recent digitisation at the British Library does typically
involve the dis-binding of volumes, followed by the re-wrapping issues
in plastic for preservation.

“I was at that time writing in the *Morning Chronicle* newspaper (of
    which one series had lately been collected and published in two
    **volumes**, illustrated by my esteemed friend Mr. George
    Cruikshank)…” \[Dickens, 11.76\]

“They were not appended to any of the material in the original folio
    sheets, and although the newspaper continued publication to 1752
    there were no further reprint **volumes**.” \[Lockwood, 91\]

“Lehden **vuosikerta**, numero, osa, sivu, päiväys/vuodenaika
    (painettu lehti, journaali)”

“I keep on my knees a **volume** of the *Illustrated News* of many
    years ago … or a **volume** of *Punch* published between the
    ‘forties and the ‘fifties” \[Sala 1894, 1.xiii\]

“I saw it the other day, to my infinite amusement, reproduced in a
    **volume** compiled from the ‘agony column’.” \[Yates, 1.328\]

“A newspaper may restart its numbering with **volume** 1, number 1,
    or an alternative designation that indicates a renumbering, without
    a change in title. This happens frequently with newspapers, often
    with a new publisher or editor.” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 26\]
