## Usage Notes

Researchers tend to group UK newspapers as **London Press**,
**Provincial Press** or **Metropolitan Press**, based on where the
newspaper was printed and where its reach was primarily felt. During the
Victorian period, there was a recognised distinction between
London/metropolitan and provincial press. In Germany, a typical small
city would have one or two newspapers, while Berlin and Leipzig had
dozens each; there were initially no national newspapers. Australia
retained a similarly regional focus in the nineteenth century:
Australia’s first newspaper, the *Sydney Gazette* *and New South Wales
Advertiser*, was printed in 1803, with *The Australian* launching in 1824. By the mid-1830s there were seven newspapers published in New
South Wales and five weeklies in South Australia. By the 1850s, Tasmania
had eleven newspapers. In nineteenth-century America, newspapers gained
wider traction initially through partisan political affiliation, and
then through the growth of the **Penny Press** of the 1830s. Many of
these papers were referred to as “**city papers**”. The US Postal
Service Act of 1792 had provided substantial subsidies, meaning that
newspapers could be delivered up to one hundred miles for a penny.

## Examples:

### As a formal part of the printed text

> Imprint ("Gedrukt bij Le Roy & Co te Soerabaya" \[Printed at Le Roy & Co in Surabaya\]) from *De Oostpost*, 31 October 1862: 4. [Delpher](http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:011061282:mpeg21:p004).
  
“It has become the fashion of late years to discard the **imprint**
    from many jobs, such as programmes, bills of fare, and the like. The
    omission of it, however, is contrary to law, and renders the printer
    liable to the penalty above stated.” \[Powell,18\]

“Our journal \[…\] from headline to **imprint**, will strive to
    inculcate thoroughly English sentiments–respect for authority,
    attachment to the Church, and loyalty to the Queen” \[Wellesley
    Index 3, 387\]

“Within every newspaper issue some elements can be found which are
    not directly part of the content but are only included for providing
    some basic information to the user. These elements are mainly the
    **title** section, the **running title** and the **imprint**.”
    \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 13\]

“In addition to naming the newspaper, the masthead may also state
    the edition, **place of publication**, designation, day of
    publication, the newspaper’s motto or philosophy, and the price.”
    \[Sagendorf and Moore, 9\]

### As a general description of its origin

“At the lower levels of the **London newspaper press** the position
    was more obscure. The legitimate cut-price thrice-weeklies,
    published between post days and circulating entirely in the London
    area, did not in the end fulfil their apparent growth potential”
    \[Boyce, 87\]

“In some respects the **provincial weeklies** formed a lower stratum
    of cheap publication in the same way that the cut-price and
    unstamped papers did in London itself” \[Boyce, 88\]

“Dr Cranfield cites the example of Peter Pass, employed to deliver
    both the *Manchester Mercury* and *Liverpool Advertiser*, who
    carried the Manchester paper to Bolton, Wigan, Preston, and Kendall
    a distance of about 80 miles” \[Boyce, 90\]

“Kartoitettuani juttujen **julkaisupaikat**, etenin tarkastelemaan
    juttujen tyylejä.”

“To his great disgust he found the **London press** far less venal
    than the Parisian had proved…” \[Vizetelly, 1.340\]

“Excellent in every department of journalism \[…\] so vast was his
    newspaper-reading that he never missed a noticeable point, not
    merely in **London**, but in the **provincial press**.” \[Yates,
    1.283\]

“For newspapers, the **place of publication** is always used as the
    first element in the qualifier. USNP catalogers generally use the
    ‘city, state’ form of the place name.” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 11\]
