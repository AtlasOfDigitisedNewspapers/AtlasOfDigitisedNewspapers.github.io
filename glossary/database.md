## Usage Notes

Many commercial newspaper digitisers were initially driven to produce
complete runs of newspapers. As the major newspapers have now largely
been digitised, there is a push to create thematic <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/sub-collection/">**collections**</a>. Gale
includes these collections as part of their wider databases but tag them
separately as a collection, which is independently searchable. In their
partnership with the British Library, for example, they undertook
digitisation in two parts, with the second part representing papers more
marginal, and less well preserved. The database name therefore indicates
which batch the issue is from.
