In the
UK, the 1842 Copyright Act, which focused on copyright for books, did
not mention newspapers directly; as such, the reprinting of articles
from other newspapers continued unabated. This was also complicated by
the 1842 Act, binding copyright to the author, when the majority of
newspapers published articles anonymously. An 1881 judgement classed
newspapers as books for copyright purposes, but there was still need for
further rulings to specify which [**article categories**](article-category.md) were protected.
In America, there was no copyright protection for foreign authors until
the 1891 Chace Act. This meant that the reprinting of articles remained
an integral feature of nineteenth-century American journalism. The Berne
Convention of 1886, signed initially by Belgium, France, Germany, Haiti,
Italy, Liberia, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom,
attempted to coordinate copyright protections at an international level,
although discussion about its applicability to newspaper content
continued into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It also ended the pirating
of works published in the British Empire and Commonwealth (Australia had
created its own copyright protections, but this did not protect
Australian authors from being reprinted in Britain until the Berne
Convention and subsequent British legislation). The US did not join
until 1988.

With regard to modern copyright of the digital images and texts, all
newspaper materials in Delpher have been cleared for third-party
copyright claims and released into the public domain, while Trove and
Papers Past have done so with much of their collections; any data from
in-copyright works are clearly identified on the web interface and in
API results. Although all nineteenth-century newspapers would now
technically be in the public domain in the UK, the British Library
retains copyright for the digital files because of the skill, judgement
and labour used in the creation of the digital image. Each database
history contains additional details about copyright within their
collection.

## Examples:

“The extent of **copyright** in news material itself was still at
    issue in the 1890s, when there were important decisions on the
    protection of press agency information.” \[DNCJ, GL, 143\]

“The 1842 Copyright Act protected **copyright** in ‘books,’ defined
    in a broad manner. However, section 18 contained special rules
    applying to the following genres: encyclopaedias, reviews,
    magazines, periodical works, or works published in a series of
    parts.” \[Cooper, 662\]

“The count hinted that he expected a trifle of £10,000 for his
    **copyright**, but Cole’s friend, Minton, did not quite see this,
    and proposed a royalty upon every copy sold.” \[Vizetelly, 1.393\]

“**Tekijänoikeus** jaetaan moraalisiin ja taloudellisiin
    oikeuksiin.”
