## Usage Notes

When microfilming or digitising, many collections rely on bound
<a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/volume-number/">**volumes**</a> of many newspaper issues, as the volume format better
preserves them. For the British Library collections, in those cases
where volumes that were tightly bound, they were partially disbound and
then shrink-wrapped and returned to the shelves in a partially bound
condition for microfilming. For Trove, some state libraries have used
formerly bound copies of newspapers, in order to get the best quality
for digitisation. The State Library of South Australia disbinds its
copies when <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/microfilm-reel/">**microfilming**</a>, as does the Library of Victoria, or they
loosen the bindings during the microfilming process in order to better
capture text near the margins. Other digitisers indicate that they do
not usually disband, as it is not usually possible to rebind them, and
this threatens the physical object. In those cases, the pages can be
harder to read as the binding interferes with the scanning process.
Owing to policies attached to federal funding for microfilming in the
United States, many of the physical collections were damaged during
disbanding for the microfilming process and were not preserved after
filming.

## Examples:

“Other examples of problems the OCR will have to overcome include;
    problems with ‘set through’, (able to see the printing on the
    reverse of the page through the paper), often due to poor
    **quality** paper, heavy inking or a combination of the two. Also
    there are printers’ errors, due to paper slippage or creased/folded
    paper causing breaks in the font during printing.” \[Ed King, 63\]

“The most brittle papers encountered were from 1860 onwards which
    typically used poorer **quality** wood pulp paper which is
    identifiable by its orange brown tinge.” \[Shaw, 13\]
