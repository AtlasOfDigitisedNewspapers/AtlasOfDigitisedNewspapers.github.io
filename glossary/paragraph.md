## Usage Notes

A paragraph is the default unit of a running text, and usually provides
a single thought or narrative.

## Examples:

“*Graphic* was published on Saturdays, and ‘Place aux Dames’
    appeared every week, typically in the middle of the newspaper and on
    one page; often, her **paragraphs** make up the top and bottom
    third, with illustrations of some recent event, sometimes a sporting
    event, comprising the middle third; sometimes her paragraphs take up
    the left two-thirds of the page, with unrelated illustrations on the
    right.” \[Cogdill, 182-83\]

“In this, it is ‘illustrative,’ and one need go no further than the
    opening **paragraphs** in order to understand just what the
    instruction might be: in the midst of life we are in death’.”
    \[Fieldberg, 14\]

“For one thing, most of the short **paragraphs** of news, which are
    so conspicuous in the folio edition, were not reprinted.” \[Bateson,
    155\]

“One of them is a proof sheet of the leader published on 18 July
    1730 in *Craftsman* No. 218 (reprinted as No. 211 and marked ‘A’),
    with corrections in Amhurst’s hand and two manuscript sheets
    corresponding to part of the printed leader, together with a
    separate ‘Foreign Affairs’ **paragraph**.“ \[Lockwood, 95\]

“A report of a meeting of ministers at Ocean Grove, for example,
    reflects in the lead **paragraph** the correspondent’s
    tongue-in-cheek attitude toward the guardians of moral
    righteousness.” \[Kwiat, 104\]

“The correct separation of the text into **paragraphs** is important
    for many reasons, especially for any kind of Natural Language
    Processing where tree- and part-of-speech taggers are used. They
    will in many cases rely on the correct start and end of sentences.”
    \[Europeana Newspapers, 48\]
