## Usage Notes

Within the newspaper layout, the **date** would appear centred
underneath the masthead and in the **folio line** (a line at the top or
bottom of a newspaper page that gives the <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/newspaper-title/">**newspaper name**</a>, <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/section-heading/">**section**</a>
and <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/page-number/">**page number**</a>, and publication date). As <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/headline/">**headlines**</a> were not in
use until late in the century, some articles would appear under a date
only. This could also indicate an article was reprinted from elsewhere
or provide the date of a telegram. Date is a very common search filter
across digital collections: Gale indicated that only around 5% of users
make use of advanced search functions, but date is used very often to
limit searches because researchers tend to know what period they want to
look at and are looking for contextual information around a specific
time. Nevertheless, the date was rarely the date the <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/date/">**issue**</a> was
printed: evening <a href="https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/edition/">**editions**</a> would obviously be printed earlier in the
day, while newspapers published in the morning would be printed the
night before.

## Examples:

### Publication Date

 ”If anyone wishes to establish precise publication **dates** for
    issues of Victorian periodicals, the advertisements in the
    *Athenaeum* and the *Times* are among the most helpful and
    accessible pieces of evidence, yet a word of caution is needed.”
    \[Woodruff and de Groot, 104\]

“Vasabladetin päätoimittaja ei antanut **päivämäärää** jolloin lehti
    olisi irtautunut RKP:stä.”

“Morning newspapers were **printed the night before**, as were most
    weekly papers. Most editions of newspapers with ‘evening’ in their
    titles were published in the morning or afternoon.” \[Hobbs 2018,
    113\]

### Date printed on the issue

“The last issue in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, is marked, ‘Vol.
    xl., No. 4503,’ and **dated** ‘October 20, 1842.’ It was:--’Printed
    and Published by Richard Sanderson, Proprietor, at *The Sydney
    Gazette* Office, Lower George-street, New South Wales.’ There is no
    intimation in this number that it is the last nor that it was about
    to cease publication.” \[Ferguson, Foster and Green, 69-70\]

“Publishers planned in advance a constructed ‘now’, a present, that
    lasted until the next issue, while the **date** at the top of the
    newspaper, ‘the single most important emblem on it’ according to
    Benedict Anderson, was rarely the date on which it was published.”
    \[Hobbs 2018, 112-13\]

“Daily newspapers and some weeklies had multiple editions in the
    nineteenth century, that is successive editions, usually with the
    same **date**.” \[DNCJ, LRB, 431\]

“With the coverage note temporal the reader gets detailed
    information about the ‘age’ of a news. This was especially important
    at former times when the transportation of news took several days
    or–if they came from abroad–even longer. In contrast to the
    coverage note spatial, the information value may not be high in
    daily newspapers, but in newspapers which are edited only once or
    twice a week or in irregular intervals an exact **date** can be of
    higher value.” \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 47\]
