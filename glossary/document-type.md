## Usage Notes

In the nineteenth century, the word “article“ was commonly used to
describe each individual piece of writing in a newspaper. As well as
articles there might be poetry, fiction, advertisements, illustrations,
announcements, errata, letters and obituaries; in periodical and
historical research, some of these other categories are also
occasionally referred to interchangeably as articles. “Item” and
“piece” are also used as synonyms, the former being more popular
in mid-twentieth century research than today. Modern readers should be
mindful of selective preservation that has sometimes meant that
advertisements and other supplementary matter are missing from
[**issues**](../issue-number), having been ripped out or removed. In the context of Library
and Information Sciences, a document is simply a record that contains
information content. It could include books, manuscripts, articles,
audio-visual material, computer files and databases. See [**article
category**](../article-category) for further subdivisions.

## Examples:

“Under her usual byline, Greville’s **article** for *The Graphic*
    describing this event competed with more substantial articles in
    London’s *Morning Post*, *Times*, and *Daily News*; her article
    nonetheless reveals her importance as a writer, at least in terms of
    what she called fashionable Society (*Gentlewoman* 108).” \[Cogdill,
    184-85\]

“The **article**’s tone, especially in its opening passages, is not
    unlike that of many early-to-mid-century newspaper articles that
    detail accidental deaths, for its text lingers not only on the deep
    sadness of the event (its melancholic, lamentable, mournful,
    grief-filled, and awful qualities) but also on its potential to
    teach readers a lesson.” \[Fieldberg, 14\]

“In December 1881, roughly thirty years after the foundation of the
    Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street, the *Daily
    Telegraph* published a lengthy **article** about the institution.”
    \[Boehm, 154\]

“The attack on Cartwright’s mill at Rawfolds, which took place on
    the night of April 11, 1812, is described at length in the *Mercury*
    of the following Saturday; almost all the **article** is quoted by
    Wroot, and need not be repeated here.” \[Rosengarten, 594\]

“Consider the following newspaper **items** dating from the eight
    years between the summer of 1853 and the summer of 1861.” \[Branch,
    576\]

“Though these **items** are probably the source of the references in
    the novel…” \[Rosengarten, 593\]

“In March 1819, the Alexandria Herald published the following
    anonymous **piece**…“ \[Gelmi, 151\]

“Between 1851 and 1861 he contributed several dozen **pieces** of
    varying kinds to newspapers.” \[Branch, 583\]

“‘A lady who has much time on her hands’ would read and re-read the
    morning paper throughout the day, according to an **article** in
    *The Journalist and Newspaper Proprietor of 1900*.” \[Hobbs 2018,
    55\]

“It so fortuned that I was as innocent of writing the **article** in
    question as I am of having murdered Eliza Grimwood, set the Thames
    on fire, or eaten the puppy pie under Marlow Bridge.” \[Sala 1895,
    1.360-61\]
