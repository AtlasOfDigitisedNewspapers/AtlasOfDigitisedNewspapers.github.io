## Language Variants

Herausgeber; Uitgever; Kustantaja; Editor.

## Usage Notes

The term publisher is used inconsistently across contemporary and
academic accounts. In general, it refers to the owner, proprietor or
principal financial stakeholder of a newspaper. When discussing the
nineteenth-century, it is usually identified as an individual, a family
or named partners as they appear in the newspaper imprint (the legal
information and address of the newspaper). Owing to the small management
and staff sizes of many nineteenth-century newspapers, the term is often
conflated, attached or used interchangeably with other recognisable
leadership or production roles including owner, proprietor,
editor, and printer.

## Examples:

### As a production role

“newspapers tend to spring from printers and periodicals from
    **publishers**” \[DNCJ, MdW, 515\]

“Anyone with the price of a newspaper plant and a message to print
    may become a **publisher** overnight.” \[Lenox Lohr, “Broadcasting
    System”, *London Times* (8 June 1939), 59, qtd. in Stamm, 56\]

“Linjan määrittelee siis **kustantaja** ja sen toteutumista valvoo
    kustantajan nimeämä päätoimittaja.”

### As a leadership role

    firm” \[DNCJ, vi\]

    \[Sagendorf and Moore, 32\]

    Mercury from 1801, was a vigorous proponent of the commercial
    interest” \[Rosengarten, 599\]
