## Usage Notes

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software recognises text from
scanned pages and is also used to populate metadata fields by
identifying title information, layout, etc. OCR first pre-processes the
image into component parts such as text blocks, sentence blocks and word
blocks. This is **zoning** and is done slightly differently by different
digitisers (sometimes by article, for example). Common OCR software is
most effective on modern Roman type; older newspapers and those using
Gothic font are difficult to OCR successfully. Delpher worked with
volunteers to improve the quality of the text of newspapers,
particularly seventeenth-century newspapers and WW2 illegal resistance
newspapers while Trove crowdsources the correction of article text to
improve accuracy.

## Examples 
“**OCR** technology successfully permits the reading of documents containing a mixture of fonts in different sizes and styles.” \[Feather and Sturges, 458\]  
  
“Normalization is the process of converting numerous, diverse files from their native formats into a smaller number of more open, preservation-oriented formats, typically upon deposit or ingest (e.g., migrating articles transcribed through **OCR** from Olive’s PrXML to METS-ALTO). Migration more generally may be employed to ensure that the content of a file type that is facing obsolescence can be rendered into a new format (proprietary or open).” \[Skinner and Schultz, 11\]  
  
“As a digital collection of text becomes bigger, the only efficient way to navigate through it is with search tools supported by good indexing. **OCR** makes this practicable.” \[Tanner, Muñoz and Ros, par. 3\]
  
"The main challenge in this case is the basic Layout Analysis as it is part of any **OCR** engine may be erroneous. E.g. distinct columns might be merged into one, large newspaper titles may be recognised as image instead of text, or the reading order may be confused." \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 12-13\]
