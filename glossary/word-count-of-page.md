## Usage Notes

The number of words on the average newspaper page decreased over the
nineteenth century, partly owing to changes in the law; in the UK, for
example, the removal of Stamp Duty, previously applied to any page
containing printed news, led to advertising becoming increasingly
integrated into the standard newspaper **page**. More generally, lower
printing costs led to newspapers having more pages while decreasing in
price. The rise of New Journalism in the UK led to the use of larger
**headlines** and more **subheadings**, further reducing the space on
the page for articles, though some broadsheets, such as *The Times* and
the *Daily News,* retained their dense columns of text*.* Long leader
articles, common at mid-century, were replaced with much shorter
front-page articles. The Victorian newspaper reader would not have been
aware of the exact number of words on the page and traditional press
historians have referred instead to “column inches”; the word count is
now available through OCR.

## Examples:

“The newspapers linked to the New Journalism which emerged towards
    the end of the century tended to cut the leading article to a short
    pithy paragraph or two, more easily digested by the speed reader.”
    \[DNCJ, JRW, 352\]

“A rough estimation shows that the number of distinguishable content
    pieces within one newspaper issue increases dramatically over the
    years. In a newspaper of the 18th century some dozens of articles
    and advertisements can be found, already in the 19th century
    hundreds of single news can be found and at the heyday of newspapers
    in the 20th century even some thousand news are included in one
    issue. This development goes along with an enlargement of the paper
    size and a reduction of the font size so that more and more text can
    be delivered to the reader.” \[Europeana Newspapers 2015, 19\]
