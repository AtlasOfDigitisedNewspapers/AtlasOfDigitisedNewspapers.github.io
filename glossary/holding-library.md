Bibliothek; Bibliotheek; Kokoelman omistava kirjasto.

## Usage Notes

The commercial digitiser Gale works with newspaper publishers directly,
including *The Times, The Independent* and *The Mirror.* However, where
the microfilm or the originals are not of sufficient quality or there
are gaps, they source missing editions from the British Library. Each
database history contains additional details about the libraries
consulted for their collection.

## Examples:

“Even by 1889, men outnumbered women in the segregated news rooms of
    Barrow’s public **library** by a factor of fifteen to one, ‘a fair
    average of the number of persons who enter the rooms daily, for the
    purpose of reading the Newspapers and Periodicals’.” \[Hobbs 2018,
    55\]

“According to the 1881 *Macmillan*’s article, the principal purpose
    of the free **library** is ‘employing the leisure time of the
    working classes in a more rational way, and weaning them from the
    degrading haunts of drink and vice through its newspapers,’ and thus
    through newspapers and books ‘carrying on the education of the
    coming race’.” \[Bernstein, n.pag.\]

“The **Library**‘s digital collection is heterogeneous, comprising
    content such as eBooks, eJournals and the UK Web Archive, digitised
    newspapers and manuscripts, digital maps and digital sheet music,
    electoral registers, patents, and personal digital archives.” \[The
    British Library, 3\]
