## Usage Notes

Genre is often used in academic accounts interchangeably with
type and format, although these terms can also be used to
specify sub-divisions such as broadsheet versus quarto. Genre can
also refer to [**periodicity and frequency**](publication-frequency.md), and distinct types such
as family papers, police gazettes and society papers. The term genre
was not commonly used in this sense in the nineteenth century.

In Trove, there are some journals that have found their way into the
newspaper digitisation project owing to practicalities at the time of
digitisation. Publications such as government gazettes, which are
technically journals, were digitised with the newspapers because they
did not have the process for journals at the time. Similarly,
[**publications**](../newspaper-title) that changed genre (such as *The Bulletin*, which
started as a newspaper but became a magazine) are listed under the first
genre for the [**run**](../publication-date-range).

## Examples:

### At the broadest level (newspaper, periodical, magazine)

“the periodical as a **publishing** **genre**“ has sustained a
    remarkable development since the 18th century.” \[Beetham, 96\]

“The second example points out the interdependence of various
    **publishing genres** in the periodical marketplace, emphasizing how
    this informed the reputations of editors and contributors.”
    \[Tilley, 210\]

“A newspaper can change its form and content to become a periodical.
    Do not make a new record to reflect a change in **format** from
    newspaper to periodical (or vice versa). Instead, give the
    information in a note. In the case of a newspaper that has changed
    to a periodical, leave the Type of Serial (008/21) code as ‘n.’
    Existing subject headings should retain their form subdivisions with
    a change in format, and additional headings may be input to reflect
    the new format.” \[Sagendorf and Moore, 42\]

“Young Ireland responded quickly to political events, and the
    newspaper **format**, with its cheapness and topicality, was crucial
    to the success of the movement.” \[Tilley, 210\]

### As a sub-category of journalism

“Although it seems a commonplace, the nineteenth-century press is
    characterized by a number of distinct **genres** beyond that of the
    usual distinction between periodicals and newspapers.” \[DNCJ, LRB,
    245\]

“The *Journal* was inserted into the market as a ‘cheap illustrated
    miscellany’, and to understand the expectations this aroused in the
    implied reader, it is necessary to sketch a history of the
    **genre**.“ \[King 2004, 49\]

“**Journalistic genres** such as news articles, editorial comment,
    foreign correspondence, political debate, court reports, financial
    bulletins, illustrations, sports coverage and even advertisements…”
    \[Nicholson 2012, 277\]

“Tiettyä **lajityyppiä** ohjaavat tietyt säännönmukaisuudet.”
