## Usage Notes

Many collections are digitised entirely from microfilm, at least
initially: for example, the Times Digital Archive was digitised from
microfilm up to 1985 but now *The* *Times’* digital PDF copy of each
issue can be used. For the British Library collections, from the early
1940s to 2010 the usual method of preserving newspapers was microfilming
and approximately 30% of the newspaper collection was microfilmed during
this time. Delpher’s policy is to digitise from paper, unless microfilm
of an acceptable quality is available. Trove has begun to digitise from
physical copies, particularly for titles that have not previously been
microfilmed. Microfilm digitisation has led to the majority of
newspapers being digitised in greyscale.
