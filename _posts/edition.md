title: Issues with Editions; Editions with Issues

**This is the first of a series of blog posts that will expand on elements of the *Atlas*, including selection 
decisions, lessons learned from our archival partners, and some of the ontological issues we found when 
working with digitised newspaper metadata.**

By one definition of a newspaper ‘edition’, all newspapers have them. The copy you hold in your hands, 
or access online, is a specific edition, made the more significant because many researchers now interact with exactly the same one; 
as Laurel Brake describes above, digitised newspapers become something new–a digital edition–in the digitisation process, because that 
single copy is preserved. The digital edition may be missing pages, or have 
[set through](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/quality/), or have advertisements removed. In these terms, ‘edition’ 
provides you with important information regarding the object you’re interacting with, and highlights that it’s distinct from other 
issues of the same newspaper. As a digital object, it becomes representative. There’s also, in this case, some blurring with the term 
[‘issue’]( https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/date/) that can be difficult to disentangle, and leads to some edition metadata 
fields being filled simply with issue numbers.  
  
By another definition, not all newspapers have editions. An edition can refer to something much more specific, to do with geography 
(town papers versus country papers), to do with size, to distinguish between multiple issues produced on the same day (morning versus 
evening editions), or to refer to issues published on different days, which might have different editors (notably the Sunday edition).

Although classifying editions might seem like a relatively straightforward point, the issues above muddy the waters significantly, 
and the decisions made as to what constitutes an ‘edition’ are often rendered invisible by the structure of digitised newspaper 
collections. Providers rarely digitise multiple editions; for example, the British Library’s Legal Deposit legislation in 1869 
stipulated that a single issue is supplied per title, and this has generally been implemented by depositing the last edition of a 
newspaper for a specific day, if multiple editions exist (although in some cases these other editions may also be held by the library).
In some collections of digitised newspapers, a Sunday variant of a newspaper is recorded as a separate title, breaking the link 
between the publications. This often makes sense: sometimes the publication has broken away from its parent title. But how do 
you record that break? When did it happen? And does the new publication still count as a Sunday ‘edition’, or is it now just a 
weekly paper?   
  
Within the metadata samples in the Atlas, this variation is clear. Our [edition]( https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/maps/edition/)
metadata map includes numbered editions (“1” or “ed-1”); it also includes “Dag” (daily edition); “Freundschaftsausgabe” 
(Friendship edition); “Special Edition”; and “Electronic ed.”. Because not all newspapers have these first categories of 
edition (numeric, indicating frequency, or indicating a one-off publication), the field is rare across collections. 
The final category, electronic edition, might seem redundant: if it’s indicating that this newspaper is digitised, 
perhaps our engagement with it through a database or XML file should be enough to remind us of that. Nonetheless,
it serves an important function in reminding us of the role of “digital remediation” in engaging with digitised newspaper collections.
