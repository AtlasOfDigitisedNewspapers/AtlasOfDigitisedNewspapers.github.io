title: Wrong Hierarchies; or, Appreciating the Value of Non-Authoritative Metadata for Digitised Newspaper Collections
author: M. H. Beals

In our [last](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/2020-04-03-found-indices), we discussed the possibilities and initial 
efforts made by librarians and other collection holders to provide access, and in some cases even integrate, existing 
newspaper indices into digitised newspaper collections. These historical ontologies—systems of categorisation and 
structures of knowledge—were constructed by individuals who maintained a certain claim to authority. This authority
is usually characterised as being intrinsic by virtue of known, scientific or otherwise correct methodologies but is
most often identified simply through association with official institutions, with the methods and practical execution 
of these categorisations left largely unquestioned by those who rely upon them. Recent debates on the decolonisation 
of the archive have highlighted the dangers of assuming that authoritative ontologies are equivalent to natural or 
correct structures of human knowledge. More importantly for this discussion, though, is the idea that categorisation 
is a fundamentally human endeavour and as with most human endeavours is prone to and benefits from infinite variety.

### Democratic Access and Social Curation

As preface to this discussion, I would draw your attention to two veins of research on access and interaction on the
internet. The first argues that the creation of the world wide web presented a particular opportunity for heritage 
institutions in widening access to their collections, transcending both the need to travel to locations where artefacts
are held, but also the limitations of space in displaying and contextualising those materials.  At the same time, this 
drive to provide access has raised concerns among providers about what materials should be made available.  Certain 
artefacts and collections, including periodical material, were either historically obtained in ways that would not be 
deemed ethical in the 21st century, or, in their original cultural context, would not be made available to all—restrictions
on ethnicity, religion and gender being commonly cited. Questions about democratic knowledge, and who has the right not only
to access but also to limit access to historical materials, will likely continue to be a matter of debate as the technology
for making vast heritage collections available online becomes more widespread and affordable.

The other debate centres not around permission but instead the means for locating and interacting with those collections. 
In the early 21st century, two main forms of non-authoritative indexing have appeared in the digital realm. The first 
is what I would refer to as non-authoritative curation and the second as social bookmarking.  From Facebook and Twiiter, 
to Youtube and Instagram, to Reddit and the now largely forgotten Delicious, internet users quickly utilised centralised 
spaces—as distinct from individual websites—as a means of bringing together diverse materials from across the web into 
curated collections relevant to their particular interests or the interests of specific sub-cultures and communities. 
While early efforts usually copied or replicated materials into new virtual locations, centralised platforms now promote
social bookmarking or linking to original materials, often held by authoritative institutions, and adding individual or 
community context through commentary or curation with other objects categorised by this specific community as related.
The practices involved in social curation are not, of course, so very different than the annotated bibliographies produced 
by groups such the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals or the innumerable community newsletters and magazines produced
by enthusiasts of all descriptions. The change is the unprecedented access people now have to these non-authoritative
curators. In the past, offline curators developed reputations for accuracy or expertise that, while different from the 
authority bestowed upon institutional collection providers, was nonetheless very powerful. These were not based upon 
qualifications or institutional longevity but on the practical fruits of curation and democratic or market-based appraisals 
of their competence.  As we have gained greater access to these non-authoritative curators, questions over the superiority 
of authoritative curation, or indexing, have naturally arisen, perhaps most popularly in discussion of "traditional" and 
"new" journalism.

### Trove as an Example of Crowdsourced Ontologies

In the realm of digitised newspapers, the Oceanic Exchanges team found that many providers found the prospect of 
non-authoritative curation and social bookmarking very alluring.  Many had posited the idea of adding such systems to 
their own collections but as of the writing of the *Atlas*, only Trove, by the National Library of Australia, had 
successfully implemented a full social curation system.  Users wishing to engage with their collections can continue 
to do so in authoritative ways, through library subject headings and other cataloguing categories, but other means of 
navigating the collections, right down to the level of newspaper article, have evolved over the past ten years.  Registered 
users are able to tag and add comments to collection materials that are visible and searchable by other users, registered 
or not, and machine-readable through the system's API. Users can also create lists, or curated collections, of materials 
across the Trove database.  What was surprising to, but very welcomed by, the Trove team was the level and rigour of 
engagement these tools engendered. Existing and new communities not only made extensive use of the centralised systems 
but created their own ontologies—their own systems for knowledge categorisation—that would be consistent, intelligible, 
and well documented.  Like offline non-authoritative guides, these lists and tagging systems can be judged democratically based
not on their correctness by virtue of institutional authority but on their practical use by those who wish to understand 
and engage with the heritage materials available. More imporantly, unlike authoritative ontologies, these not need be destroyed
or removed in order to be supersceded by more useful and relevant ontologies in the future.

### Future Possibilities of Integration and Exchange

Research into social bookmarking and tagging has produced mixed feelings about the value of non-authoritative ontologies. 
There is a gnawing sense amongst many that allowing users to create and share human-crafted ontologies should result in
better, more intelligible and more robust systems of knowing than automated (or AI) web crawling. That has not been the case. 
To date, much of the literature considers social tagging and bookmarking to be a tremendously noisy process. Many tags are 
only used once, misspelled or unintelligible as relevant to the object to which they are attached. Other tags are over-used 
and genericised, well worn general stand-ins for more specific and nuanced categories. Yet, what these researchers only
tacitly acknowledge, and what gives me great hope for the prospects of social curation for heritage collections, is the idea 
that, in the end, truth will out.

Human beings are deeply flawed, biased and inconsistent creatures.  I love that about human beings.  Everyone who reads a 
newspaper article comes to it with a different personal ontology, a different way of understanding the world. Sometimes these
overlap; sometimes we mistake overlaps where they don't exist or miss them where they do.  But slowly, over time, we have 
learned to communicate with each other, more or less. No system of non-authoritative subject heading will ever be correct, 
and most will be far nosier and less consistent than authoritative ones. Yet, does that really  matter?  The research into 
social bookmarking suggests this. Even though many of these ontologies were arguably less robust or consistent than mechanical
ones, they had the virtue of producing a very different structure and selection of entry points. I would argue that the 
creation of doorways is just as important as the creation of rooms. There is a lot of inefficient overlap and noise in the web
of connections that exist across the internet, but do the ten-thousand sub-Reddits I never visit preclude the value I find 
in the six I do?  To those who wish to block out the noise of the fake and irrelevant, I ask you to have a bit more 
faith in your fellow man—academic or enthusiastic—to understand the difference between "correct" and "useful" for a
particular task.  

The questions of access and organisation within authoritative collections and archives are likely to continue for some time
more, but in the realm of the digitised newspaper, I can only applaud the efforts and faith of the Trove team and hope that
we can work together to find other site of social curation.
