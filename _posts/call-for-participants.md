As part of [DH2020](https://dh2020.adho.org/), we will be hosting a workshop about the *Atlas* for users of digitised newspaper collections.

Building upon the two-year Digging into Data project, [*Oceanic Exchanges: Tracing Global Information Networks in Historical 
Newspaper Repositories, 1840-1914*](http://www.oceanicexchanges.org), this workshop will introduce participants to the *Atlas 
of Digitised Newspapers*, a comprehensive guide to the histories, structures and metadata of the digitised newspapers collections 
studied by the project, including those held by:
 
* Chronicling America (The Library of Congress)
* The Hemeroteca Nacional Digital de México
* The British Library
* The Times Digital Archive
* Delpher (Koninklijke Bibliotheek)
* Europeana
* Suomen Kansalliskirjaston Digitoidut Sanomalehdet
* Trove (The National Library of Australia)
* Papers Past (The National Library of New Zealand)
* ZEFYS (Berlin State Library)
 
The *Atlas* provides readers with a deep contextualisation of these collections as well as detailed technical information about 
how to obtain, interpret, manipulate and map metadata and content across collections. Discussions will be supported by two additional 
online resources–an interactive visualisation of the metadata mapping and a linked dataset to support cross-database research.  
 
Starting with humans rather than technologies or tools, the *Atlas* specifically uncovers the people behind the metadata and 
selection decisions. The workshop demonstrates a commitment to continuously co-constructing this work, and we hope to foster 
future collaborations. The *Atlas* will encourage research that “analyzes the historical and continued impacts of colonialism, 
postcolonialism, and hegemony”; siloed national archives privilege collections that look inward, but *Oceanic Exchanges* has used the 
combined collections to explore multilingual/multicultural groups with future possibilities for work on comparative Indigenous studies.
 
## The aims of the workshop are to:
 
* Present the findings and outputs of the project;
* Create a space for critical discussion of the findings and future research opportunities by participants of the workshop;
* Allow for initial collaborations and hands-on use of the outputs in developing historical, literary, and computer science research 
questions.
   
All participants will have the opportunity to submit and review the following in advance of the workshop:
 
* An online profile of previous work with digitised newspapers and historical periodicals;
* Suggestions for possible in-workshop collaborations using the *Atlas*, visualisations and LOD datasets across our core expected 
disciplines.
  
## Learning Outcomes
  
By the end of the workshop, participants will: 
 
* Develop a nuanced understanding of available data beyond OCR text;
* Practice cross-collection data management and cleaning;
* Develop an understanding of metadata and selection practices.
