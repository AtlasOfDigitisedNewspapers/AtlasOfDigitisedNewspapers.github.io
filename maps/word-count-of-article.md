This field is uncommon, because often issues are zoned by **page**
rather than by article.

## Individual Collection Notes

zoned on the page, or if it takes into account any other pages including
article text.

TDAG: It is unclear if the word count applies only to the article as
zoned on the page, or if it takes into account any other pages including
