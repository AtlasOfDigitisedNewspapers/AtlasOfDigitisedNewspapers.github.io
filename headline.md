## Language Variants 

Überschrift; Titel; Otsikko; Titular. 

## Technical Definition

Provides the headline or title of the item. This may be hand-keyed or the result of OCR in addition to a **section heading.** This is non-standardised.

## Usage Notes

For most of the nineteenth century, the front page of major daily newspapers would include classified adverts rather than headlines in a larger font size; in the UK, *The Times* continued this practice until the 1960s. The British New Journalism of the 1870s and 80s saw the introduction of headlines to catch readers’ attention. Type-revolving presses, used in the 1840s and 1850s, made it impossible to have headlines across more than one **column** until the rotary presses made it possible to design a layout horizontally rather than simply vertically. Even when the technology allowed, Australian newspapers were similarly reluctant to adopt them until the end of the century. The term itself was more commonly used in the nineteenth century for book layouts, referring to the running title, **pagination** and other information at the top of the page. Within the pages of the newspaper, article titles were often fixed from **issue** to issue (for example ‘Advertisements & Notices’, ‘Provincial News’), comparable to the idea of a regular column today. Because titles were not commonly used (they were more common in periodicals), many databases do not zone by article but by page. Gale and Trove are exceptions. Gale segment by article, but with older newspapers do not try to figure out where one article starts and ends. Many providers hand-key and check titles and headlines.
