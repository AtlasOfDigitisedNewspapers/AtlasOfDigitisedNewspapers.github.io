### <a name="existing">Updating an existing glossary entry  </a>
The glossary entries are intended to provide a short literature review of each term 'in the wild', as well as an account of how it was understood in the nineteenth century. We also welcome additional language variants, usage notes and examples to our existing entries. 
  
For **language variants**, please simply add the term alongside the existing variants.
  
**Usage notes** encompasses both the history of the term and its use in digitised newspaper collections. When adding information to this section, please also add any sources to our [bibliography](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/introduction/bibliography/) using MLA style. We especially welcome historical information concerning the development of the newspaper in non-Anglophone countries. Please ensure these usage notes are focused on the nineteenth-century newspaper rather than modern newspapers. 
  
We are particularly interested to record variant terms and their use (for example, frequency versus periodicity) and more granular detail (such as the distinctions between daily, weekly, and monthly publications). These alternate terms can also be added to the [glossary index](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/).

We welcome new entries in our glossary. The glossary is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to newspaper history and layout as there is a wealth of scholarly literature on this subject, but should be tied to what is present in the metadata.
  
Please create a new glossary entry under [http://atlasofdigitisednewspapers.github.io/glossary/](http://atlasofdigitisednewspapers.github.io/glossary/) as \[chosen-title.md\]. 
  
Ensure you also add the new entry to [http://atlasofdigitisednewspapers.github.io/glossary/](http://atlasofdigitisednewspapers.github.io/glossary/)index.md as a link (the entries are in alphabetical order), so that it is visible on the [glossary page](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/).
  
**Language Variants**  
For content, citation, bibliographic and holdings metadata, we aim to include language variants representing the countries we have worked with on the project (Dutch, Finnish, German, Spanish). Please feel free to include other languages. These variants should be verified with reference to the literature rather than drawn from a translation tool.
  
**Usage Notes**  
This section should include relevant information about the entry's evolution in the nineteenth century, and what term(s) would have been understood by contemporaries. For those based on layout terminology, please provide a specific description that makes it clear what is being referred to. You may also want to include relevant detail from the history of digitisation itself, where applicable.  Please link your glossary entry to the corresponding [metadata map](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/maps/). 
  
**Examples**  
These can be drawn from nineteenth-century primary sources, but should primarily focus on how periodicals researchers, historians, digitisers, archivists and library scientists have used the term. Please add any new sources to our [bibliography](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/introduction/bibliography/) using MLA referencing. A good starting point is *[Victorian Periodicals Review](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/304)* or the *Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism* (ed. Marysa Demoor and Laurel Brake, 2009) for historical uses, and published [IFLA proceedings](https://www.ifla.org/annual-conference/proceedings) for archive and library science usage.
