We hope the *Atlas* will be a place for users not only to learn about digitised newspaper collections and metadata, but also  to find other [resources](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/introduction/web/) â€” particularly (but not exclusively) scripts and tools that have used our guide and/or dataset. You are very welcome to add links to the following:

### <a name="projects"></a>Example Projects

External projects using digitised newspaper data. Please provide a short summary of the project (3-5 lines).

### <a name="tools"></a>Tools

Scripts or other tools to manipulate or make use of digitised newspaper databases. Please include a few words to explain what the tool does.
  
### <a name="resources"></a>Resources

Written or visual resources discussing or aiding the use of digitised newspapers and metadata.
