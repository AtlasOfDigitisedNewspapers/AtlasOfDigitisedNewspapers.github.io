We hope the *Atlas* will be a place for users not only to learn about digitised newspaper collections and metadata, but also  to find other [resources](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/introduction/web/) â€” particularly (but not exclusively) scripts and tools that have used our guide and/or dataset. You are very welcome to add links to the following:


### Example Projects

External projects using digitised newspaper data. Please provide a short summary of the project (3-5 lines) and a link to a relevant website.

### Tools

Scripts or other tools to manipulate or make use of digitised newspaper databases. Please include a few words to explain what the tool does as well as a link to the relevant website or Github repository.
  
### Resources

Written or visual resources discussing or aiding the use of digitised newspapers and metadata. Please provide a short summary as well as a link to the resource.
