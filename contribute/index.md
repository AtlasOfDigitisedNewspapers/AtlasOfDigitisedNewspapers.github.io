The *Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata* is the result of the two-year *Oceanic Exchanges* project. Now that the project has concluded, we are hoping that you, the GLAM, digital humanities and periodical studies community, will help develop and expand our initial work. In order to ensure consistency and robustness of the information, we ask that you contribute to the *Atlas* using the procedures listed below. 

## Basic procedures

Whether you wish to make a simple or substantial contribution to the *Atlas*, we ask that you use the Github 'pull request' mechanism to do so. To make changes, clone [our respository](https://github.com/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers.github.io) and make changes to your version of the website. Once you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request. We will then approve it, merging it with the current online *Atlas*, or send your comments to help improve or finalise the edits. All updates should be written in markdown rather than HTML, following [GitHub's guidelines](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Using the 'pull request' mechanic not only streamlines the process of contributing, but allows us to maintain a full provenance record of your contribution. If would like to discuss alternative methods for contributing to the *Atlas*, or want to discuss a possible addition informally, feel free to contact [Melodee Beals](m.h.beals@lboro.ac.uk) or [Emily Bell](e.bell@lboro.ac.uk). 

Please note that while we greatly appreciate, and will gladly accept, contributions from both database providers and end-users of all descriptions, we ask that you include references or other provenance information (such as your role within an organisation, if relying upon your experience) to the 'pull request' message, so that we can better evaluate claims before integrating them into the *Atlas*, and provide provenance information for those relying upon the *Atlas* in the future. This is especially the case for details regarding funding or governance.

### File Structure

You can find the relevant pages of the *Atlas* under:

- Templates for new pages: The '_inprogress' folder.
- [Database histories](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/histories/): The 'histories' folder
- [Metadata maps](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/maps/): The 'maps' folder
- [Glossary entries](https://www.digitisednewspapers.net/glossary/): The 'glossary' folder
- All other pages: The 'introduction' folder

## Substantial Edits

If you wish to make a substantial contribution to the project, such as a new page or updating multiple maps to include a new database, please visit [Issues](https://github.com/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers.github.io/issues) and create a new issue for your project.  This will allow us to track your progress, provide you with advice, and allow other members of the community to support you. Once you have done this, follow the instructions below:
