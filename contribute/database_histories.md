If you would like to add a new collection or database added to the *Atlas*, you will need to provide a fully referenced collection history with technical specifications, interface descriptions and access information.

## Creating the New History

To begin your database history page, use the following section headings, using the [provided template](https://github.com/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers.github.io/blob/master/_inprogress/template_history.md):

### History of the Collection
	
A brief 1-2 paragraph summary of the history of the collection, including its predecessor projects, its aims and objectives, its main funders and its governance structure. You may wish to include an inline logo for the collection

#### Consulted Libraries

A semi-colon separated list of all the libraries or other organisations that contributed materials to the collection, whether in microfilm, hardcopy or digitised form

#### Microfilming Projects

A brief history of the microfilming processes that have affected the selection and quality of the database

#### Digitisation Projects

A brief history of the digitisation projects or development phases that contributed to the current database

###### Selection

A brief summary and history of the selection rationale for the collection, including the aims of funders or preceding projects as well as the role and composition of any selection advisory boards

###### Preservation and Access

A brief summary of the role of the digitised collection in terms of preservation and conservation as well as public or commercial access to the materials

### Composition of the Collection

#### Selection Available

A brief summary of the main contours of the collection in terms of chronology, geography, language, periodical type and major thematic sub-collections. This should give an indication of percentages as well as absolute numbers of titles, issues and pages in these categories

#### Data Quality

###### Text

A brief summary of the quality of the text, namely the OCR or manually-corrected metadata and data fields within the database, and how this was gauged. This should attempt to give an overall indication of accuracy as well as discuss which parts of the collection (language, period, geography, time of digitisation) are likely to have better or worse than average accuracy ratings

###### Images

A brief summary of the filetypes and resolutions of the images in the database, both in the backend collection as well as those available through the user interface and direct download

#### Metadata Schema

A summary of the metadata schemas employed by the collection in the data, metadata and structure files. Links to bespoke standards or documentation should be supplied if available

#### Backend Structure

A summary of the backend file structure of the database, including an indication of the data (text or image) that is available, even if this is not accessible by end users. It should include file directory structures if possible

### User Interface Structure

#### Web Interface

A summary of the *current* web user interface. If no web interface is currently available, please indicate this rather than leaving this section blank or removing it

#### API

A summary of the *current* API. If no API is currently available, please indicate this rather than leaving this section blank or removing it

#### Direct Download or Drives

A summary of the structure of the *current* direct download packages or text-mining drives. If these are currently unavailable, please indicate this rather than leaving this section blank or removing it

### Rights and Usage

A general notice of the rights for scholarly, commercial and personal use of the materials and the accessibility of the collection to various end-users

#### Web Interface

A brief summary of copyright and other terms of conditions of use for material obtained through the web interface

#### API and Direct Download

A brief summary of copyright and other terms of conditions of use for material obtained through the API, direct downloads or text-mining drives

#### Re-Publication

A brief summary, including links to relevant documentation or notices, on the ability of users to republish text or images from the collection for personal, scholarly and commercial purposes
	
## Completing the New History

Once you have completed your entry, submit a pull request, placing a full bibliography in your pull request comment as well as by editing the [bibliography page](../../introduction/bibliography).
	
It is important for the consistency of the *Atlas* that all sections be completed prior to publication. If you feel you can only provide information for a sub-section of the history, post details of your contribution to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers/AtlasOfDigitisedNewspapers.github.io/issues), so that other members of the community can contribute to or complete the entry and push your entries to the `_inprogress` folder, rather than `hisotries`.
