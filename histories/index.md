The following report abbreviates the histories of the nine newspaper
databases used in the *Oceanic Exchanges* project, providing information
on thirteen instantiations of the data across web interfaces, APIs and
text mining drives. This includes a chronology of the development of
each, a discussion of its aims and offerings, and a report on its
current status and availability. These histories will also include a
discussion of the data within the collection, its overall structure and
technical detail. The following repositories are discussed:
