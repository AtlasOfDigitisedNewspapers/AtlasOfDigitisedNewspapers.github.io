The *Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata* is the result of the two-year project *Oceanic Exchanges*. Now that the project has concluded, we are hoping that you, the GLAM, digital humanities and periodical studies community will help develop and expand our initial work. In order to ensure consistency and robustness of the information, we ask that you contribute to the Atlas using the procedures listed below.  If you have any questions, or want to discuss a possible addition more informally, feel free to contact [Melodee Beals](m.h.beals@lboro.ac.uk) or [Emily Bell](e.bell@lboro.ac.uk).
