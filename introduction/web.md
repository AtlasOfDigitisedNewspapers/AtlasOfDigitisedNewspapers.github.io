## External Projects

#### <img src="../../img/pointinghand.png" width="50" style="margin:0px 20px 0px 0px"> [The Oceanic Exchanges Project](http://www.oceanicexchanges.org)

Through computational analysis, Oceanic Exchanges crosses the boundaries that separate digitized newspaper corpora to illustrate the global connectedness of 19th century newspapers. The project uncovers how the international was refracted through the local as news, advice, vignettes, popular science, poetry, fiction, and more. By linking research across large-scale digital newspaper collections, OcEx offers a model for data custodians that host large-scale humanities data.

The Scissors and Paste Database is a collection of manual transcriptions from British newspapers (1789-1850), alongside originals from colonial and American newspapers. It aims to be a central repository of reprinted news across the 19th-Century Anglophone world. In order to facilitate the discovery of new reprints and reuses, the site also contains the Scissors-and-Paste-o-Meter, which allows users to view possible instances reprints and reuses across multiple digitized newspaper databases. The SAP-o-Meter currently maps reprints with the British Library Newspaper Collection (JISC1, 1800-1900), The Times Digital Archive (1800-1900), The London Gazette (1800-1837) and the National Library of Australia’s Trove (1800-1837).

This site presents data, visualizations, interactive exhibits, and both computational and literary publications drawn from the Viral Texts project, which seeks to develop theoretical models that will help scholars better understand what qualities—both textual and thematic—helped particular news stories, short fiction, and poetry “go viral” in nineteenth-century newspapers and magazines.

This tool harvests metadata (and optionally full text and PDFs) from searches in Trove's digitised newspapers. It's available both as a Python command-line tool, and embedded in easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks that can be run online without installing any software. The harvested metadata is saved in a CSV file. If requested, the OCRd text of every article (stripped of HTML tags) will be saved in a separate text file. This repository also includes examples of analysing the harvest results using Jupyter notebooks.
