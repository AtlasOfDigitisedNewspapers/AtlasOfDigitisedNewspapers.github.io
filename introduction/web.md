## Projects

### [The Oceanic Exchanges Project](http://www.oceanicexchanges.org)

Through computational analysis, Oceanic Exchanges crosses the boundaries that separate digitized newspaper corpora to illustrate the global connectedness of 19th century newspapers. The project uncovers how the international was refracted through the local as news, advice, vignettes, popular science, poetry, fiction, and more. By linking research across large-scale digital newspaper collections, OcEx offers a model for data custodians that host large-scale humanities data.

### [Scissors-and-Paste](http://www.scissorsandpaste.net)

The Scissors and Paste Database is a collection of manual transcriptions from British newspapers (1789-1850), alongside originals from colonial and American newspapers. It aims to be a central repository of reprinted news across the 19th-Century Anglophone world. In order to facilitate the discovery of new reprints and reuses, the site also contains the Scissors-and-Paste-o-Meter, which allows users to view possible instances reprints and reuses across multiple digitized newspaper databases. The SAP-o-Meter currently maps reprints with the British Library Newspaper Collection (JISC1, 1800-1900), The Times Digital Archive (1800-1900), The London Gazette (1800-1837) and the National Library of Australia’s Trove (1800-1837).

### [The Viral Texts Project](https://viraltexts.org)

This site presents data, visualizations, interactive exhibits, and both computational and literary publications drawn from the Viral Texts project, which seeks to develop theoretical models that will help scholars better understand what qualities—both textual and thematic—helped particular news stories, short fiction, and poetry “go viral” in nineteenth-century newspapers and magazines.
